As illustrated in the diagram above, this is the process I will follow to produce the analysis results. Here, I will create a Summary Report using two datasets: fact_kpi_month_dataraw and fact_txn_month_dataraw. By generating the Summary Report, we can load the data into Power BI to produce comprehensive dashboards on revenue and expenses.  
To calculate the metrics in the Summary Report, specific business knowledge is required. Below are two files that will support you in understanding the necessary business knowledge: huongdan_data and param_dim_data.  
In this file, I will focus on calculating the Summary Report. The KPI ASM report file will follow a similar process, and I will include the code for it in the repository for reference.
